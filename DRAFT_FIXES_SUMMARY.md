# Draft Saving & Restoring Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Database Initialization Problem**
**Issue**: The Draft table was empty and didn't have the 256 draft slots (16 rounds Ã— 16 picks) initialized.

**Fix**: 
- Added `initializeDraftSlots()` function in `lib/database.ts`
- This function creates all 256 draft slots with proper team assignments
- API endpoint now automatically initializes slots when needed
- Each slot is pre-populated with team_id but no player data

### 2. **Progress Calculation Error**
**Issue**: The `getDraftProgress()` function had flawed logic for calculating the next pick.

**Fix**:
- Improved logic to find the last pick with an actual player
- Added proper bounds checking (won't go beyond round 16)
- Better filtering of picks with actual player data
- More robust next pick calculation

### 3. **State Synchronization Issues**
**Issue**: Component state and database state were not properly synchronized.

**Fix**:
- Complete rewrite of the draft restoration logic
- Now properly maps database picks to local state
- Handles missing players gracefully with placeholder data
- Maintains proper team assignments and draft order

### 4. **Error Handling and Logging**
**Issue**: Limited error handling and debugging information.

**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive error handling in `makePick()` and `autoPick()`
- Added console logging for debugging
- Added admin debug panel showing database vs local state
- Better error messages and state rollback on failures

### 5. **API Endpoint Improvements**
**Issue**: API lacked validation and proper error handling.

**Fix**:
- Added field validation for draft picks
- Better error messages and status codes
- Automatic draft slot initialization
- Proper cleanup when clearing draft

## Key Changes Made

### Database Functions (`lib/database.ts`)
```typescript
// Fixed progress calculation
export async function getDraftProgress() {
  const picks = await getDraftPicks();
  const picksWithPlayers = picks.filter(p => p.player_id && p.player_id.trim() !== '');
  // ... improved logic
}

// Added draft slot initialization
export async function initializeDraftSlots() {
  // Creates all 256 draft slots with proper team assignments
}
```

### API Endpoint (`app/api/draft/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Auto-initialize draft slots
await initializeDraftSlots();

// Added validation
if (!round || !pick || !teamId || !playerId || !playerName || !position || !team) {
  return NextResponse.json(
    { success: false, error: 'Missing required fields for draft pick' },
    { status: 400 }
  );
}
```

### DraftRoom Component (`components/DraftRoom.tsx`)
```typescript
// Improved draft restoration
useEffect(() => {
  if (dbDraftPicks.length > 0) {
    // Complete rewrite of restoration logic
    // Properly maps database state to component state
  }
}, [dbDraftPicks, progress])

// Better error handling
const makePick = async () => {
  try {
    // ... pick logic
    await savePick({...});
  } catch (error) {
    // Rollback state and show error
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

### 1. **Initial Load**
- API automatically creates 256 draft slots if they don't exist
- Each slot has team assignment but no player
- Component loads and shows empty draft board

### 2. **Making Picks**
- Pick is made in local state
- Pick is immediately saved to database
- If save fails, local state is rolled back
- Error message shown to user

### 3. **Restoring Draft**
- Component loads database state
- Maps database picks to local state
- Restores current round/pick position
- Removes drafted players from available list
- Shows proper draft progress

### 4. **Error Recovery**
- Failed picks don't corrupt state
- Database errors are logged and displayed
- Admin debug panel shows state differences
- Manual refresh button available

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. **Clear the Draft Table**
```sql
DELETE FROM Draft;
```

### 2. **Open Draft Room**
- Should automatically initialize 256 slots
- Check browser console for initialization logs

### 3. **Make a Pick**
- Should save to database immediately
- Check browser console for save logs
- Verify pick appears in draft board

### 4. **Close and Reopen**
- Draft should restore to exact same state
- Current position should be maintained
- All picks should be visible

### 5. **Check Debug Panel** (Admin Only)
- Database picks count should match local picks
- Progress should show correct next position
- Log buttons should show state in console

## Admin Debug Features

The debug panel (admin only) shows:
- Database vs local pick counts
- Current round and pick
- Progress information
- Available players count
- Selected player state
- Buttons to log state to console

## Future Improvements

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for live draft updates
2. **Draft History**: Track all draft changes and timestamps
3. **Export Functionality**: Export draft results to various formats
4. **Backup/Restore**: Save draft state to files
5. **Multi-draft Support**: Handle multiple draft sessions
