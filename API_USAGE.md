## üõ†Ô∏è Frontend Usage Examples

### Using React Hooks

```javascript
import { useTeams, usePlayers, useLeagues } from '@/hooks/useApi';

function MyComponent() {
  const { data: teams, loading, error, refetch } = useTeams();
  const { data: players } = usePlayers({ position: 'QB' });
  const { data: leagues } = useLeagues();

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Teams ({teams?.length})</h2>
      {teams?.map(team => (
        <div key={team.id}>{team.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Direct API Service Usage

```javascript
import { apiService } from '@/lib/api';

async function handleCreateTeam() {
  try {
    const newTeam = await apiService.createTeam({
      name: "My New Team",
      owner: "My Name",
      leagueId: "l1"
    });
    console.log('Team created:', newTeam);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating team:', error);
  }
}
```

## üìä Data Structure Examples

### Team Object
```javascript
{
  id: "t1",
  name: "The Touchdown Titans",
  owner: "John Doe",
  leagueId: "l1",
  players: ["p1", "p2", "p3"],
  record: { wins: 2, losses: 0, ties: 0 },
  pointsFor: 248.6,
  pointsAgainst: 224.2
}
```

### Player Object
```javascript
{
  id: "p1",
  name: "Josh Allen",
  position: "QB",
  team: "BUF",
  nflTeam: "Buffalo Bills",
  stats: {
    passingYards: 328,
    passingTDs: 3,
    passingInts: 1,
    rushingYards: 42,
    fantasyPoints: 32.4
  }
}
```

### League Object
```javascript
{
  id: "l1",
  name: "Friends & Family",
  type: "Standard",
  teams: ["t1", "t2", "t3", "t4"],
  settings: {
    maxTeams: 12,
    scoringType: "Standard",
    playoffTeams: 6,
    tradeDeadline: "2024-11-15",
    waiverType: "Standard"
  },
  currentWeek: 3,
  season: 2024,
  isActive: true
}
```

## üîß Error Handling

All API methods return consistent error responses:

```javascript
// Success Response
{
  success: true,
  data: { /* your data */ },
  message: "Operation completed successfully"
}

// Error Response
{
  success: false,
  error: "Error message here"
}
```

## üéØ Common Use Cases

### 1. Creating a New Team
```javascript
const createNewTeam = async () => {
  const team = await apiService.createTeam({
    name: "Fantasy Champions",
    owner: "Your Name",
    leagueId: "l1"
  });
  console.log('New team created:', team);
};
```

### 2. Adding Players to a Team
```javascript
const addPlayerToTeam = async (teamId, playerId) => {
  const team = await apiService.getTeam(teamId);
  const updatedPlayers = [...team.players, playerId];
  
  await apiService.updateTeam(teamId, {
    players: updatedPlayers
  });
};
```

### 3. Updating Player Stats
```javascript
const updatePlayerStats = async (playerId, newStats) => {
  await apiService.updatePlayer(playerId, {
    stats: {
      ...newStats,
      fantasyPoints: calculateFantasyPoints(newStats)
    }
  });
};
```

### 4. Managing League Standings
```javascript
const updateTeamRecord = async (teamId, wins, losses, ties) => {
  await apiService.updateTeam(teamId, {
    record: { wins, losses, ties }
  });
};
```

## üöÄ Testing Your API

You can test the API endpoints directly in your browser or using tools like Postman:

- **GET** `http://localhost:3000/api/teams` - Get all teams
- **POST** `http://localhost:3000/api/teams` - Create a team
- **PUT** `http://localhost:3000/api/teams?teamId=t1` - Update a team
- **DELETE** `http://localhost:3000/api/teams?teamId=t1` - Delete a team

## üìù Notes

- **In-Memory Storage**: Currently using in-memory storage. Data will reset when you restart the server.
- **ID Generation**: Simple timestamp-based IDs are generated automatically.
- **Validation**: Basic validation is included for required fields.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages.

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Add a Database**: Replace in-memory storage with PostgreSQL or MongoDB
2. **Add Authentication**: Implement user authentication and authorization
3. **Add Real-time Updates**: Use WebSockets for live scoring updates
4. **Add Data Validation**: Implement more robust validation rules
5. **Add Caching**: Implement Redis for better performance

Your PFL API is now fully functional for managing fantasy football data! üèà
